For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
Output is ABC as ABC repated once gives string 2 and repated twice gives string 1 
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
Ouput is AB but not ABAB although both contain ABAB because ABAB repated once gives str2 but for ABABAB to
occur it should be repated 1.5 times which is not possible 
Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
